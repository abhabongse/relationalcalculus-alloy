# Master's Project at UC Santa Barbara

- **Project title:** Safety Checking for Domain Relational Calculus Queries Using Alloy Tools
- **Advisor:** Prof. Tevfik Bultan

## Project description

This report and presentation files are created for my master's project at UC Santa Barbara. It attempts to analyze the safety of Domain Relational Caculus (DRC) query model: a query is considered safe if the result of the query is always consistent regardless of what is the domain of database scalar entries.

## How PDF files are generated

- Report PDF file was generated using **LaTeX** via **texlive** package.
- Presentation PDF file was created and is editable using [**IPE**](http://ipe.otfried.org/).
