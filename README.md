# Domain Relational Calculus query model safety check using Alloy Analyzer

This project provides a tool as an Alloy library to analyze the safety of
Domain Relational Calculus (DRC) query model. A query is considered safe if
the result of the query is always consistent regardless of what is the domain
of database entries.

More updates coming soon.
